# Hey there, I'm Reshma 👋

I'm a Computer Science student who believes that great software isn't just built — it's crafted with logic, creativity, and a lot of late-night debugging.

When I'm not chasing down a rogue semicolon, I’m building full-stack apps, designing real-time systems, solving algorithms, experimenting with AI models, or turning images into pointillist art (because why not? 🎨).

I'm passionate about **full-stack development**, **systems programming**, **cybersecurity**, **AI**, and **using tech to solve real problems**.

## 💻 What I Work With
- **Languages**: Python, Java, C, C++, Go, JavaScript (Node.js), HTML/CSS basics
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: JavaFX (GUI Applications), Pygame (Python Games and Tools), WebSockets (Real-Time Communication), basic Node.js server frameworks
- **Tools & Databases**: SQLite (Relational Databases), command-line interfaces (Windows/Linux), Virtual Machines (Ubuntu), version control (Git), Notepad++ and IDEs for coding across languages.
